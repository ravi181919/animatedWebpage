# greenSock Animation Project

This is a simple HTML project demonstrating the use of the GreenSock animation library (GSAP) for creating animations.

## Description

This project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). The HTML file contains a basic structure with a navigation bar and a home section. The GreenSock animation library is included via a CDN link. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains code to animate elements on the page using GSAP.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see the navigation bar and home section with images. The JavaScript file contains code to animate these elements, demonstrating the capabilities of GSAP.

## Installation

There is no installation required for this project. However, if you wish to customize or extend it, you can download the files and edit them using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
